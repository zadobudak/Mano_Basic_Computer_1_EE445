\section{Introduction}
This report documents the simulation and testing of a basic computer design. The assembly program that was executed and the first part of simulation results can be found in the following parts. For the full simulation results, please refer to the "test\_res.txt".

\section{Assembly Program}
The assembly program used for the simulation is as follows:

\lstinputlisting[caption=Assembly Program,label=assembly-program]{program.txt}

\section{Simulation Results}
The simulation results generated by running the assembly program on the basic computer design are presented below:

\section{Controller Design}
The controller is designed with almost fully combinational parts except the needed Sequence Counter. Every output is calculated logically with assigned inputs. For debugging the last part of the commented code is used , it resides in Controller.v file. The design is fully taken from lecture notes. Every instruction is tested by me. Because of length of tests and their results only a part of it present in the report.
